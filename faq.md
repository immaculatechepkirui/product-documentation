## For Farmers

**Q1: How do I register for a training session?**
A: You can register for training sessions through the mobile application. Browse the available sessions, select the one you're interested in, and follow the registration steps.

**Q2: How can I pay for a training session?**
A: You have two payment options:
    1.  **MTN Mobile Money (MOMO):** You can pay directly using your MTN MOMO account.
    2.  **Reward Points:** If you have enough accumulated reward points to cover the full cost of the session, you can use them to pay.

**Q3: How do I earn reward points?**
A: You earn 7 reward points for each training session you attend.

**Q4: What is the value of a reward point?**
A: Each reward point is equivalent to approximately 1.43 Rwandan Francs (RWF). For example, 7 points are equivalent to 10 RWF.

**Q5: Can I use points if I don't have enough to cover the whole session cost?**
A: No, you can only use reward points if your balance is sufficient to cover the entire cost of the training session. Otherwise, you will need to pay using MTN MOMO.

**Q6: How will I know if my registration and payment were successful?**
A: After successful registration and payment (either via points or MTN MOMO), you will receive a confirmation notification via SMS or a push notification on the mobile app.

**Q7: What happens if my MTN MOMO payment fails?**
A: If your MTN MOMO payment fails, your registration will not be confirmed. You will need to attempt the payment again. The system will provide feedback on the payment status.

**Q8: How can I check my reward points balance?**
A: You can check your reward points balance at any time through the mobile application.

## For Admins & Extension Workers

**Q1: How does the system handle payments?**
A: The system integrates with the MTN MOMO API for mobile money payments. For point-based payments, it deducts points directly from the farmer's balance. All transactions are recorded.

**Q2: How are reward points managed?**
A: 7 reward points are automatically granted to a farmer after they attend a session. The system tracks all earned and spent points for each farmer.

**Q3: What kind of data can we access through the web portal?**
A: The web portal allows you to view:
    *   Registrations per session and per farmer.
    *   Farmers' current reward point balances.
    *   Detailed payment history and summaries.
    *   Overall session attendance and participation.

**Q4: How are notifications sent to farmers?**
A: We use Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) to send notifications for payment confirmations, session registration alerts, and other important updates. These can reach farmers even if the app is not actively open.
