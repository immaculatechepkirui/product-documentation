# Welcome to the Cooperative Training Platform

Empowering Rwandan farmers through accessible training and innovative technology.

## About Our Project

This project aims to streamline the process of training session registration, payment, and reward management for farmers within our cooperative. We are developing a web portal for administrators and extension workers, alongside a dedicated mobile application for farmers.

Our system facilitates:
*   Easy registration for training sessions.
*   Flexible payment options, including MTN Mobile Money (MOMO) and reward points.
*   A transparent reward system where farmers earn points for session attendance.
*   Clear communication through notifications for confirmations and updates.

We believe that by leveraging technology, we can enhance the learning experience and operational efficiency for everyone involved in the cooperative.
