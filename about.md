# About Us

## Our Mission

Our core mission is to empower farmers in Rwandan cooperatives by providing accessible, high-quality training and leveraging technology to simplify administrative processes. We aim to enhance agricultural knowledge, improve livelihoods, and foster a stronger, more connected farming community.

## The Project

This initiative focuses on developing a digital platform tailored to the needs of a Rwandan cooperative. The platform consists of:

*   **A Web Portal:** For cooperative administrators and extension workers to manage training programs, track farmer participation, oversee payments, and generate insightful reports.
*   **A Mobile Application:** Designed for farmers, enabling them to easily discover training sessions, register, make payments (via MTN MOMO or earned reward points), and monitor their reward point balances.

## Our Approach

We are building a system centered around the user experience of both the farmers and the administrative staff. Key elements of our approach include:

*   **Simplicity and Accessibility:** Ensuring the mobile app and web portal are intuitive and easy to use, even for those with limited digital literacy.
*   **Local Relevance:** Integrating with locally prevalent payment solutions like MTN Mobile Money and designing a reward system that provides tangible benefits (points convertible to Rwandan Francs).
*   **Efficiency:** Automating processes like registration confirmation, payment validation, and reward point allocation to reduce manual effort and improve accuracy.
*   **Transparency:** Providing clear information to farmers about session costs, payment status, and their reward point history.
